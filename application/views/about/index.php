                <h2>Kelly<br />Carter</h2>
                <p>I am a recent graduate from the <a href="https://www.mica.edu/" target="_blank">Maryland Institute College of Art</a> [MICA], I graduated with my BFA in Graphic Design. I love getting to create both web and print work, always with a focus on detailed typography. I look forward to the times I can sit and tediously set type, page after page after page. Currently, I am honored to be working with an inspiring group at <a href="https://drxlr.com/" target="_blank">Drexler</a>.</p>
                <p>If I’m not designing, I spend as much time in, on, or around water as I can manage — scuba diving, boating, and swimming (especially when sea turtles are involved).</p>
